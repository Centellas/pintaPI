# pinta.PI

This repository is a part of a project from the subject Robotics in the Computer Engineering Degree of Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona (UAB.cat). 

Pinta.Pi is a 2d plotter which takes a photo, then it transforms it into pointillism and then draws it on a paper, using Python 3 and OpenCV 4. Here you will find all the code for the project, and more instructions to build a version of your own.

The project uses 2 stepper motors and one servo, along all the materials needed (metal bars, 3d printer strings, printing headers, etc)

**What you will need:**

* Python 3
* OpenCV 4
* PiCamera / webcam python libraries

**What added from this repository**

* Servo and stepper controllers
* Camera capture module
* All the transformation software is used to edit the photo.
